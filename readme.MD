In this session, we'll walk through the process of loading a tabular dataset into Python, inspecting the data, and taking a first look at some of the variables. We'll also cover basic Python and pandas syntax and discuss some of the different kinds of data you might encounter.

after sitting through the first session, i find the time not well spent. The instructors are engaging and the little bit of material they managed to get through in the hour was useful. The issue in my mind is the pace was too slow and didnt get through near enough material. Just my thoughts, maybe i have been doing this long eenopugh and this was geared towards a noob or something. For me i was hoping this would be a good side learning program to my current course with jon krohn, but probably not.

In this session, we'll continue to investigate our data with summary statistics and some basic data visualizations, using the Python libraries NumPy, pandas, matplotlib, and Seaborn. We'll also discuss how to choose an appropriate summary statistic to answer a particular question.

3. Jan 26, 2021 @4-6pm

In this session, we'll cover ways of assessing a relationship between two variables, using both summary statistics and data visualizations. For example, how could we use clinical trial data to get a sense of whether a vaccine appears to work?

4. Feb 2, 2021 @4:30-6:30pm

In this session, we'll introduce inferential statistics and hypothesis testing by learning about the central limit theorem (CLT). The CLT is the mathematical theory behind a number of commonly-used hypothesis tests, and we will demonstrate it using simulation (no math-y formulas)!

5. Feb 9, 2021 @4-6pm

In this session, we'll implement our first hypothesis test, but we'll do it by writing our own simulation-based function in Python. The code might get a little tricky here, but the lessons learned will be invaluable for any statistician, data scientist, or data analyst.

6. Feb 16, 2021 @4-6pm

In this session, we'll discuss some of the problems that can arise when hypothesis testing is misused. We'll cover error types and investigate some of the problems that can arise when a single study involves multiple tests.

7. Feb 23, 2021 @4-6pm

In this session, we'll turn our attention to hypothesis tests that can be used to evaluate an association between two variables among a population that we can't observe. If we have time, we'll even simulate our own two-sample t-test.

8. Mar 2, 2021 @4-6pm

In this session, we'll talk about experimental design and sample size determination in the context of an A/B test. A/B testing is often used by marketers to compare two versions of a website or product to determine if one is better for business.
